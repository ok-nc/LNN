### A physics-based deep neural network implemented in Pytorch

### The main aim of this work is to utilize constraints provided by fundamental physics to improve deep learning models applied to problems in artificial electromagnetic materials (AEMs). 

### Constraints of causlity are enforced by including a "Lorentz layer" in the deep neural network (DNN) architecture that predict the complex dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability.

### From the complex optical constants (epsilon and mu), the scattering parameters (i.e. reflection and transmission coefficients) and various other physical quantities are predicted from the Lorentz model.

### A trained LNN model is able to learn the individual Lorentz parameters of eps and mu from the input geometry.
